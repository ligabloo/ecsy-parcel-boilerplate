# ECSY Parcel Boilerplate

A simple boilerplate project for using [ECSY](https://ecsy.io) with [Parcel](https://v2.parceljs.org/).

Directly inspired by [`MozillaReality/ecsy-webpack-boilerplate`](https://github.com/MozillaReality/ecsy-webpack-boilerplate).

```
npm install
```

```

The bundled code will be output to the `/dist` directory.
